# Hangman-Game
Two-player Hangman Game (Python)

This program generates a simple hangman game for two players.
To start the game, the first player enters a secret word.
The second player is able to guess the secret word until the number of chances are run out.
The number of chances will depend on the length of the secret word.
To re-match after the game is over, the play can input the "Y".
